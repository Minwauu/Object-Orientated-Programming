# Object-Orientated-Programming#

### Quick Fire Five

- **Low cohesion and high coupling - what would make that a bad choice?** - The relationship between the modules would be strong but the sub-programs within each module would be weak and so the high coupling is ineffective.
- **Why should you avoid exception handing to manage the normal or expected flow of control in your program?** It would make the program too complex to understand and difficult to locate where things went wrong. If you know the issue, if/elif/else would be more reasonable. 
- **What is a breakpoint? Can you examine a variables value in the Console window in REPL? Can you change a variable's value? Can you call a function defined in the program?** - https://replit.com/@Minwauu/Breakpoint#main.py 
- **The three combining principles are** Selection, sequence, iteration.

## Objects

Pyhton is an *object-orientated* programming language.

An *object* is a combination of variables (also called *attributes* or *instance variables* or *object variables*) and behaviours (i.e, functions, which are referred to as *methods* in the object context)

To create an object, you need to create a *class* using the keyword *class* as follows:
